# RoseTree (WIP)
FASTA Blast and Phylogeny Constructor with Metadata
Originally was made to run Roseobacter samples (hence the name). 

This is currently a python program I am starting to develop as part of my summer position at VIU.
Most of this program is a learning experience and is mostly my first time delving into a Python project. There will likely be some errors and bugs that I will be working through over the summer.
