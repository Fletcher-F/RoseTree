# RoseTree (WIP) ðŸŒ³
## Fasta BLAST and Metadata Phylogeny Constructor Pipeline

RoseTree is a pipeline tool that will BLAST a given FASTA nucleotide input using GenBank's API,
and construct a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree with metadata from results.

- Written in Python using Biopython and ETE3
- Parses and joins XML output into new FASTA file for alignment.
- Outputs blast results, alignment, metadata, and final phylogeny.

## Description

This is a Python project I am starting to develop as part of my NSERC Undergraduate Summer Research Award at VIU.
This is my first time working with Python and much of the project is a learning experience. There will likely be some errors and bugs that I will be working on throughout the summer.

## Upcoming Changes

- Allow user to specify metadata to include.
- Verification of bootstrapping cutoff and model testing
-

## Automation 

Since some of the phylogeny rendering relies on personal preference, some portions of the pipeline cannot be fully automated. If you would like to change how the final render looks and customize the tree, please take a look into the rosephylogeny.py where I have some commented sections indicating how it can be customized.  

## Installation

Currently no package exists. To run, copy the repo and run rosetree.py locally.
Example: 
```
python3 rosetree.py -i ./test/input.fasta -t 8 -e myemail@gmail.com
```

## Required Libraries

ETE3, Biopython, MAFFT, Trimal, RaXML-NG, Modeltest-NG
